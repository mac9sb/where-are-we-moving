# deno-template

Starter template for Deno apps built on
[`@mac9sb/deno-foundation`](https://jsr.io/@mac9sb/deno-foundation).

Includes passwordless auth (magic links + passkeys + Sign in with Apple), Deno
KV persistence, a URL-pattern router, i18n, static file serving, and structured
logging — ready to deploy on Deno Deploy.

## What's included

- `/get-started` — sign-in page: magic link, passkey, Sign in with Apple
- `/auth/verify` — verifies magic-link token and creates a session
- `/auth/apple` — accepts an Apple identity token and creates a session
- `/auth/passkey/*` — WebAuthn registration and authentication endpoints
- `/auth/success` — post-auth landing page with passkey registration prompt
- `/auth/logout` — POST to revoke session and sign out
- `/api/session` — returns current session user or 401

## Development setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in your values — see Environment variables below
deno task dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

**Magic links**: set `BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000` and a real
`RESEND_API_KEY`. To skip email delivery locally, you can temporarily
`console.log` the token in `magic_link.ts` — it's printed in the server terminal
and you can paste it directly into `/auth/verify?token=...`.

**Passkeys**: work on `localhost` without HTTPS — no extra configuration needed.

**Sign in with Apple**: Apple's JS SDK only activates on domains registered in
your Apple Developer account. For local testing, use an
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com) tunnel (`ngrok http 8000`) and register that domain
in your Services ID configuration, or test on a registered staging URL.

## Environment variables

| Variable                | Required | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BASE_URL`              | Yes      | Full origin URL, e.g. `https://myapp.deno.dev`                                          |
| `RP_NAME`               | No       | Passkey relying-party display name shown in the system prompt (default: `My App`)       |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`        | Yes      | [Resend](https://resend.com) API key for sending magic-link emails                      |
| `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`       | No       | Apple Services ID (web) or bundle ID (native). Required to enable Sign in with Apple.   |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`     | No       | Stripe secret key — uncomment the Stripe block in `index.ts` to activate billing routes |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No       | Stripe webhook signing secret                                                           |

## Production checklist

- [ ] Set all required env vars in the
      [Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com)
- [ ] Point your custom domain and update `BASE_URL` to match exactly (passkeys
      bind to the origin)
- [ ] Verify your sending domain in [Resend](https://resend.com) and update the
      `from` address in `magic_link.ts`
- [ ] **Passkeys + native client**: add an
      [`apple-app-site-association`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains)
      file at `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` and add the Associated
      Domains entitlement in Xcode — this lets iOS save passkeys under your
      domain rather than just the app
- [ ] **Sign in with Apple (web)**: create a Services ID in the
      [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com), register your
      domain and redirect URI (`<BASE_URL>/auth/apple`), then set
      `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` to the Services ID and update the
      `<meta name="apple-client-id">` tag in `public/get-started.html` to match
- [ ] **Sign in with Apple (native)**: add the Sign in with Apple capability in
      Xcode and set `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` to the app's bundle ID on the server —
      Apple uses the bundle ID as the `aud` claim in the identity token for
      native flows
- [ ] **Stripe**: register `<BASE_URL>/billing/webhook` in the Stripe dashboard,
      copy the signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, then uncomment the
      Stripe block in `index.ts`

## Deploy

```bash
deployctl deploy --project=<your-project-name> index.ts
```

Or connect the repo in the Deno Deploy dashboard for automatic deployments on
push.
